# VisualProgramming
*I developed an interface that we can choose a file. It decides what format the selected file is and provides the necessary solution.*

## File Types
*It is a program that reads data encrypted in 6 different ways and uses these data to produce an photo with animations. Let's explain these different data named p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6 in more detail below.*

## P1
*The P1 type consists of 0 and 1 data and using them as contrasting colors, we arrange each value to show one pixel to obtain a black and white image.*

## P2
*The P2 type consists of data between 0-255 and we arrange each value to show one pixel to obtain an RGB color image.*

## P3
*The P3 type consists of data between 0-255 and we arrange 3 values to show one pixel to obtain an RGB color image.*

## P4
*The P4 data type is binary data. We need to read the data in this file as bytes. We also need to separate the excess from the data we receive here. Actually, this data type is like the binary format of P1. For this reason, the result will be a black and white image again.*

## P5
*The P5 data type is binary data. We need to read the data in this file as bytes. Actually, this data type is like the binary format of P2. For this reason, the result will be a RGB color image again.*

## P6
*The P6 data type is binary data. We need to read the data in this file as bytes. Actually, this data type is like the binary format of P3. For this reason, we arrange 3 binary values to show one pixel to obtain an RGB color image.*
